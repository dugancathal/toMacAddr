toMACAddr.jquery.js
------------------------------

A simple plugin for formatting delimited lists of MAC Addresses in HTML.

Usage:
------------------------------

Given some HTML:
  <p>Some MAC Address:Â <span class='toMacAddress'>00:a:1:B:d2:c</span></p>

And a dash of JS:
  $('.toMacAddress').toMacAddress({joiner: ':'});

You get:
  Some MAC Address: 00:0a:01:0b:d2:0c

It's really that simple.  Pretty cool, huh?


Additional options:
------------------------------

joiner: Should be one of ':', '.', '-', or '' for correct formatting.
        If ':' or '-' (or anything else, for that matter) are used, the MAC is split into groups of two (2) and rejoined.
        If '.' is used, the MAC is split into groups of four (4) and rejoined.

casing: 'upper' or 'lower' (defaults to 'lower')

abortOn: If you want to skip on a given match, use this
         Use Case: You have a form where the same input can be used for multiple things, but one of those is a MAC, you can specify an escape character (set) to abort the MAC formatting.  (defaults to /[\/ ]/)

splitOn: The text delimeter for multiple MACs (defaults to /,/)
